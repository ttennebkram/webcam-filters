# Claude Code Preferences for Webcam Filters Project

## Git Workflow
- NEVER actually commit to git unless explicitly requested by the user
- DO suggest commits occasionally when it makes sense (e.g., after completing a significant feature)
- But DO NOT suggest commits after every small change
- Only actually execute git commit when user explicitly says "commit" or "create a commit"

## Documentation
- NEVER create documentation files (*.md, README, etc.) unless explicitly requested
- Exception: Source code comments and docstrings are always appropriate
- This includes:
  - No README files
  - No CHANGELOG files
  - No documentation markdown files
  - No API documentation
- But DO include:
  - Inline code comments when helpful
  - Function/class docstrings
  - Module-level docstrings

## Working Style
- Focus on code implementation over documentation
- Ask before making structural changes
- Prioritize working code over perfect documentation
